                Ever wondered how to make your favorite type of ramen broth for your own use?
                In this recipe, we will teach you how to create a simple but tasty shio ramen 
                broth that will go well with even instant noodles. This process will take 3-4 hours 
                with a decent amount of time paying attention to the broth to make sure that nothing 
                goes wrong. This will serve 1-2 people, but the broth is reusable for multiple meals.
